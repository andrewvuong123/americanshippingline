# Website For American Shipping Line
First web development mini-project! The freight forwarding company American Shipping Line's website had not been touched/updated since 2006 so I thought it'd be a fun task to reimagine the website in 2019. The new website for American Shipping Line aims to make the company site more user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and help improve marketing to potential customers.
